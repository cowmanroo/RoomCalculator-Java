# RoomCalculator-Java
Simple java program that takes as input the dimensions of a room and outputs the:

Area of the floor\n
Amount of paint required to paint the walls\n
Volume of the room\n

I only recently learnt a bit of java, I understand the need for error handling just don't have the experience (I'm 15).
